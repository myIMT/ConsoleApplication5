HistogramTest:
Just testing Src->Gray->Mask->Canny.
Just testing Walk along CannyEdge- for every coordinate (i,j) of CannyEdge:
 - get (i,j) pixel value from NewAngle
 - call this pixel value A(i,j)
 - calculate Bidx = A(i,j)/5 = x
 - Bin(x) = Mask(i,j) pixel

Then calculate Max ......

This is done for one component ONLY.
Need to now calculate Angles/NewAngles on all components , then:
 - walk through each component & Sobel, Mag & Angle, Canny, NewAngle, container (global container for all components frequencies)
