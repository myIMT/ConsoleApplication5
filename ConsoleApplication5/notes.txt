		//is this gray or binary?
		//cast to binary since original connectCJPG suppose to be binary

		//use neighbourhopod of original image to calculate angle from binary
		//walk through binary get equivalent neihbourhood form orignal and claculate Angle

		//read image, filter (denoise), connectedComponent (binary), contouring (single pixel think contour = edge), walk along edge get neigh from orihinal and calculate angle, mag of edge point
