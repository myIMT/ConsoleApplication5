sequence of implementation:
1)read in src image
2)filter src image
3)convert filtered src image to gray-scale
4)convert grayscale image to binary
5)calculate connectedComponentStats of filtered gray-scale image.
	-- connectedComponentStats accepts 	a 8-bit single-channel image to be labeled
	-- accepts a binary image as input
	-- outputs matrix containing all components and count of components
	-- -- can use use count to iterate through components matrix to extract each component
	-- -- -- generate mask to obtain each component , save that component but also calculate contour from component
6)use findContours to calculate contours
	-- findContours take as input, component (mask),contour mode and contour approximation
	-- -- contour mode = RETR_EXTERNAL = return all boundary contours (level 0 contours)
	-- -- contour approximation = CHAIN_APPROX_NONE = return all points inside calculated contours
