Histogram of Angles:
 -- data = angles of component (Mat)
 -- range = 0-360 (range of our component angles values)
	-- minimum range value = 0
	-- maximum range value = 360
 -- dims = 1 (number of parameters we want to collect data of - we only want to collect data of angles)
 -- bin size = 5 (each bin is 5 degrees wide)
 -- bins (histSize)= 360/5 = 72 (number of subdivisions in each dims) (size of histogram)
